# Next.js 15 App Router: Unexpected Link Component Behavior

This repository demonstrates an unexpected behavior with the Next.js 15 App Router's `Link` component.  Navigation using the `Link` component sometimes fails, resulting in unexpected page rendering or blank pages.

## Bug Description

The issue manifests when navigating between pages using the `Link` component within the app directory.  The expected behavior is a smooth transition to the target page. However, in some instances, the navigation fails, either leading to a blank screen or incorrect content rendering.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Navigate between the Home and About pages using the links provided.

Observe that in certain instances navigation does not function as expected.

## Solution

This specific bug requires a detailed investigation, potentially involving the application's routing configuration, data fetching mechanisms, and component lifecycle methods.
Further investigation into the application's context is needed to pinpoint the root cause.
